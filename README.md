# TeconMoon-WiiVC-Injector-Jam
This is a version of the TeconMoon WiiVC Injector, which was created by TeconMoon (GBAtemp.net) originally. That was then modified by Timefox, which was then forked to this version.

The difference here is that it uses "java -jar JNUSTool.jar" instead of "JNUSTool.exe".

Why? Because the exe version was failing due to some "Assistive Technology" library issue. After failing to fix it by installing everything that seemed necessary, I just decided to fork the project and run things a different way.

The original release post is https://gbatemp.net/threads/release-wiivc-injector-script-gc-wii-homebrew-support.483577/.

Many thanks to TeconMoon for this great work and sharing, and to Timefox.
